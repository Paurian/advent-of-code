Advent of Code is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, [university](https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home) [coursework](https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html), [practice](https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584) [problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), a speed contest, or to [challenge each other](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some [problem solving skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/) will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
